## Associate Performance Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook and associated files for analyzing the performance of three associates (ABC, XYZ, KLM) in a business development role. The analysis is based on a dataset provided in the "Data Assignment.xlsx" file.

### Objective

The objective of this analysis is to evaluate the performance of each associate in terms of lead generation. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and key performance indicator (KPI) calculations. Insights derived from the analysis aim to provide actionable recommendations for the Business Development Team.

### Files

- **Data Assignment.xlsx:** Excel file containing the dataset for each associate.
- **Associate_Performance_Analysis.ipynb:** Jupyter notebook containing the Python code for the analysis.

### Key Steps in the Analysis

1. **Data Cleaning & Transforming:**
   - Renamed columns for consistency.
   - Removed duplicate dates to prevent data distortion.
   - Checked and filled null values with 0 in columns 'No. of Leads' and 'Time Spent on LG.'

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Provided an overview of associate information.
   - Computed summary statistics for each associate.
   - Created boxplots to identify outliers in 'No of Leads' and 'Time Spent on LG.'
   - Conducted correlation analysis between time spent and leads generated.

3. **Optimal Time Frame Analysis:**
   - Determined the optimal time frames for each associate based on leads generated.

4. **Leads Frequency Analysis:**
   - Analyzed the frequency distribution of leads generated by each associate.

5. **Monthly Leads Trend:**
   - Examined the trend of average leads generated monthly by each associate.

6. **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
   - Calculated KPIs, including Average Leads per Day, Average Time Spent per Day, Conversion Rate, Total Leads Generated, and Lead Generation Efficiency.

7. **Answered Questions:**
   - Provided answers to specific questions regarding total leads generated, total leaves taken, average leads, and consistency in lead generation.

8. **Decision on Missing Values:**
   - Explained the rationale behind turning missing values into zero, particularly in 'No. of leads' and 'Total time spent on lead Generation' columns.

### Forecasting (Excel):
   - Due to the limited dataset, forecasting was performed in Excel to predict future trends.

### Instructions for Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn).

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
   - Open the Jupyter notebook "Associate_Performance_Analysis.ipynb" using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

4. **Review the Analysis:**
   - Execute each cell in the notebook to see the step-by-step analysis and visualizations.

5. **Explore Insights:**
   - Review the insights derived from the analysis, and use them to make informed decisions for the Business Development Team.

### Notes

- **Forecasting:**
  - Forecasting was performed in Excel due to the limited dataset, making it challenging to predict accurate trends using machine learning.

- **Data Privacy:**
  - Ensure compliance with data privacy and confidentiality policies when using real-world datasets.
